// Who may do what in a family. One table, read by route handlers (enforced)
// and by screens (to hide what you can't do). Generation (elder/adult/child)
// is who you are in the tree; access is what you may do:
//   owner  exactly one (the creator): everything an admin can, plus handing
//          the family over, deleting it, and billing.
//   admin  up to 3 counting the owner: lets joiners in, removes people,
//          changes roles, edits the tree, moderates, runs care. Admins never
//          read others' private things (sealed morning letters, partner
//          orders, safety check-ins they weren't chosen for).
//   member shares, voices, wishes, plans, care tasks, invites (joiners wait).
//   teen   (13-17) shares, voices, wishes, stories. No care, Trusted nearby,
//          Send something, or being at someone's window.
//   child  (0-12) a profile only, no login.
// Elder mode is a setting, not a role. A pending member can do nothing yet.
