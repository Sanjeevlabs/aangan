// Every feature since PR #1, in five rooms of a house (SPEC §29.3). The
// single source of rooms → ordered tabs. The rooms sheet shows only the five
// rooms; a room opens on its first tab, and inside it the tab row (lib/spaces.ts
// → RoomHeader) is the only way sideways. A room with one page (Kitchen) has
// no tab row. Every tab is its own page: no two tabs anywhere share one.
// Safe & sound is not here: it lives on the window, the first screen.
// Settings is not here either: tap your own photo. Inviting family opens the
// invite sheet in place (the tree page, the dock, the window), never Settings.
// Children (teen or child access) don't get Portrait: only grown-ups start one.
